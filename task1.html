                    It's been a rocky start to the year for Bitcoin, but experts still say it will hit $100,000 — and that 
                    it's more a matter of when, not if. Bitcoin's price climbed above $45,000 Sunday for the first time since
                    March 2 and topped $47,000 Monday morning after it had been stuck around $40,000 in recent weeks. 
                    The price continues to hover around $47,000 as of Wednesday morning.

                    The fifteenth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) has given a bunch of talented young youngsters. 
                    This year, just 11 games after the new season, we have a number of players like Ayush Badoni, Tilak Verma, 
                    Vaibhav Arora and Lalit Yadav who have shown glimpses of their talent for their respective franchises. 
                    These players are now being seen as key players, precisely assets, for their teams in a very short span 
                    of time. It won't be an exaggeration to say that they have taken the cricketing world by storm by 
                    showcasing their skills.
